Project Overview  

This project implements and compares several machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify MRI scans into four stages of Alzheimer’s disease:  

1. Non-Demented 
2. Mild Demented 
3. Moderate Demented 
4. Very Mild Demented 

The goal is to build an accurate, reproducible pipeline for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease from MRI images. 

Features & Highlights -

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for high-accuracy image classification (~91% test accuracy).  
Class balancing and data augmentation to handle imbalanced datasets and improve model robustness. 
Traditional ML models: SVM, KNN, and ensemble learning for comparative performance analysis. 
End-to-end ML workflow: data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization. 
  

Tools & Libraries: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
