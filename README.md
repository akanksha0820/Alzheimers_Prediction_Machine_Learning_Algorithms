Project Overview

This project implements and compares several machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify MRI scans into four stages of Alzheimer’s disease:

Non-Demented

Mild Demented

Moderate Demented

Very Mild Demented

The goal is to build an accurate, reproducible pipeline for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease from MRI images.

Features & Highlights

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for high-accuracy image classification (~91% test accuracy).

Class balancing and data augmentation to handle imbalanced datasets and improve model robustness.

Traditional ML models: SVM, KNN, and ensemble learning for comparative performance analysis.

End-to-end ML workflow: data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization.

Tools & Libraries: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
